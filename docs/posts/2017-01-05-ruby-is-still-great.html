<p>I realized something today:</p>

<p><strong>Ruby is still great.</strong></p>

<p>I’ve spent the last couple of weeks digging into some of the newer/fancier/shinier technologies that have been the focus of the development world lately – specifically Elixir, Phoenix and Elm – and while I’ve thoroughly enjoyed them all (and instantly had a bunch of fun ideas for things to build with them), there are still software projects where an interpreted, loosely-typed scripting language like Ruby is the better fit.</p>
