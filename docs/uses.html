<h2 id="operating-systems">Operating Systems</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Like many of you, I do pretty much all of my development on <strong>macOS</strong>, currently on a 2012 <strong>13” MacBook Air</strong> that is in desperate need of replacing (I’m waiting for those new MacBook Pros that are coming this fall.) I appreciate macOS’ short update cycles and usually work with the latest version available (yes, even the .0 releases – I like living dangerously.)</li>
  <li>There’s also a self-built <strong>Windows 10 PC</strong> living in my office, which I mostly use for gaming (when I find time for it) and testing stuff on Windows.</li>
  <li>Even though I’m impressed by what they can do, I’m not a huge fan of blindly throwing everything at Google’s or Amazon’s cloud infrastructure offerings, so I usually end up setting my own servers for client projects or my own. I usually do this at <strong><a href="https://www.df.eu/de/cloud-hosting/">DomainFactory (formerly JiffyBox)</a></strong>, and I almost always install the latest LTS release of <strong><a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a></strong> on these machines. There are probably leaner Linux flavors (or even other operating systems) out there for servers, but it’s the one I’m used to (and would also use on a local machine if needed), so that’s that.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="daily-tools">Daily Tools</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I currently do all of my browsing and most of my web-related development in <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a></strong>.</li>
  <li>It’s not the fastest editor, but probably the one with the biggest momentum right now – I do pretty much all of my coding in <strong><a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a></strong>. Before Atom, I worked with <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev">Sublime Text</a> for quite a while; it’s still a great editor, and certainly speedier than Atom, but its development has become irritatingly erratic. On my servers, I use good old <strong>Vim</strong>.</li>
  <li>Even if I feel quite comfortable with the Git command line, I very much enjoy using <strong><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a></strong> for creating actual commits and browsing a project’s history. For most of everything else, I usually fall back to the command line interface.</li>
  <li>I’m apparenly quite boring and use the stock macOS <strong>Terminal.app</strong> for all my terminal needs. There once was a time where this wasn’t a smart thing to do, and I totally understood why everyone was flocking to iTerm back then, but Terminal.app has really turned things around over the last couple of years and become quite capable.</li>
  <li>I’m using the excellent <strong><a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon</a></strong> for desktop automation and window management. <a href="https://github.com/hmans/homedir/blob/master/.hammerspoon/init.lua">Here’s my Hammerspoon script</a>.</li>
  <li>Yup, I’m still using <strong><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a></strong>, but I have to admit that I don’t do much with it beyond launching stuff – and since Spotlight has become much better over the last years, it would probably suffice.</li>
