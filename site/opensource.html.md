# My Open Source Projects

If you look at my [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/hmans), you will find a relatively long list of public repositories -- 61, at time of writing this. Many of these are, of course, the usual mix of one-shot projects, short-lived experiments, and forks of other projects, but some of them are, in fact, projects that I'm actively (and proudly) maintaining.


### Active Projects

**[Flutterby](https://github.com/hmans/flutterby) is a web development framework** that aims to simplify the development of small to medium-sized web sites and applications. It can be used as a static site generator, but also as a framework for dynamic server-side applications, offering a smooth migration path from one to the other.

**[Slodown](https://github.com/hmans/slodown) is a comprehensive user input rendering pipeline** packaged as a RubyGem. It wraps around some powerful rendering and sanitization libraries and adds some sane defaults. I use it in all my projects that render user-provided Markdown or HTML, and so should you. :-)


### Legacy Projects

Some noteworthy projects that I'm no longer actively maintaining include [Pants](https://github.com/hmans/pants) (and its never-completed rewrite [IndiePants](https://github.com/hmans/indiepants)), a decentralized web publishing platform based on [IndieWeb](http://indieweb.org/); [rbfu](https://github.com/hmans/rbfu), a minimal Ruby version switcher; [Schnitzelpress](https://github.com/hmans/schnitzelpress), a light-weight Ruby blogging engine; [bumpy](https://github.com/hmans/bumpy), a little CLI tool that will bump your gem's version number; and [Happy](https://github.com/hmans/happy), a routing-tree web application framework for Rack, many of whose ideas now live on in [Flutterby](https://github.com/hmans/flutterby).
