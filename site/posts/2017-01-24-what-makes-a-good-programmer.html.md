title: What Makes a Good Programmer?

- other article: https://dimitrov2k.wordpress.com/2017/01/22/what-does-it-take-to-be-a-good-programmer/
- it's good, I agree with it
- but I want to take it one step further
- need to define what a "good" programmer is
- writes fast performing code?
- writes maintainable code?
- ships fast?
- have seen all of these in people I would not consider _good_ programmers
- so there must be something else.
- am I a good programmer? that depends.
- I believe I work well and provide quality results, and fast
- but I know shocklingly little about programming
- could never build my own compiler
- (but I could probably learn how to do it)
- I build things that qualify as "good programs"
- but at the same time ask worryingly dumb questions
- so here's my take on what makes a good programmer:
- (and I am perfectly aware that I may be wrong:)
- don't be afraid to ask questions
- don't be afraid, full top
- be humorous, self-deprecating (= humble); none of what we do _really_ is important
- at the same time, be accountable, reliable
- accept that you don't know everything
- realize others also don't know everything
- keep the big picture in mind: there's not just you, there's also your team, your product manager, your boss, your employer, etc.
- use the tools (text editors etc.) that you like, but don't obsess over them; your most important tool is your brain
- most importantly, don't use something only because others use it. A specific text editor will not make you a better programmer
- use your brain before you use your text editor
- communicate openly and without fear
